  <p class="quote">"There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. 
    You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite 
    the something you were after."

<blockquote>
  <p class="quote">“Deep in the forest a call was sounding, and as often as he heard 
    this call, mysteriously thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back 
    upon the fire and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on 
    and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the call sounding 
    imperiously, deep in the forest.”
  </p> -Jack London, Call of the Wild
